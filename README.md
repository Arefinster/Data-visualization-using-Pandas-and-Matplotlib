# Module-5-Challenge

Summary: This is an exercise on the Pandas and the Matplotlib libraries. It contains skill-building challenges on combining the Pandas 
and the Matplotlib libraries to process, analyse, visualize and communicate data.

Inferences:

1. The mean tumor volume after treatment by Capomulin was 40.675 mm3 which was almost same as 40.216 mm3 as obtained after treatment by 
Ramicane. These were the smallest mean tumor volume measurments compared to those obtained from the rest of the drug regimens. This 
finding indicate that Capomulin works as good as Ramicane in minimizing the tumor growth. In these cases, the tumor volume standard 
deviations were 4.994 and 4.846, respectively which were again lowest among the rest. This shows that the volume variability among the 
mice were also the lowest indicating the consistant performance of these drugs.

2. The box plots for Capomulin and Ramicane show normal distributions and smaller IQR which are at lower levels compared to that observed
for Infubinol and Ceftamin. This again addresses better performance by Capomulin and Ramicane.

3. With the Capomulin treatment, there is a strong positive correlation between the mouse weight and the final tumor volume. Heavier 
weight of the mice resulted in larger tumor volume.


 
 

NOTE: The source code is located in the file named 'pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb'. I have worked on this assignment by myself. However, 
I took help from the BCS learning assistants. They gave me directions with example code snippets. In addition, I reviewed all the class
materials, several tutorial sites, Pandas and Matplotlib documentation sites.
